        Traveling keeps me grounded. Meeting new people, exploring diverse
        cultures & cuisines allow me to view things from a fresh perspective.
        Mountains to me, in many ways, echo life&apos;s lessons. I firmly
        believe that sometimes, the journey matters more than the destination, &
        true peace follows the struggle.
